title: About

ðŸ‘‹ I'm a software engineer, manager, writer, and wannabe Bible nerd, currently living in Omaha, NE.

Right now, I'm leading a team of web and mobile developers in a massive conversion effort taking a Windows thick-client application to the web at [DMSi](https://dmsi.com). Before that I spent time in eCommerce and building a CMS for a white label application.

I'm also a Christian and am obsessed with the Bible and the surrounding scholarship. I'm also really interested in how history, sociology, and economics come to bare on the spiritual formation of folks. 

My goal is to find for myself and the community I surround myself with a pathway of spiritual formation rooted in the ancient/future rhythms of the Church that balances scholarship, pastoral care, worship, and personal practice.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Renddslow) where I mostly retweet scholars and clergy that I resonate with or on GitHub where I do a lot of open development. Here my thoughts are largely bifurcated between [tech](/tech) and [Christian spirituality](/blog), I've kept them separate to make navigation easier.
